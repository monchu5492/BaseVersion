    <h1>WildAlmonds</h1>
    WildAlmonds is a platform built around an easy to use Drag and Drop functionality centered around a stacked rank
    voting system.
    <br />
    <h3> Why start with a stack ranked voting system?</h3>
    Companies should be fun, flexible, and sustainable. Often, teams are faced with multiple options rather
    than a single choice. Using the wisdom of the crowd philosophy (what would please the most individuals or what
    most believe to be the most likely) greatly improves the final outcome. Basically, we all need to have access to
    an easy experience that gets us to a what matters decision quickly.
    <h3> So how do I use it?</h3>
    The solution works on 4 simple core concepts:
    <h4>Creation:</h4>
    <strong>Create an account at:</strong> <a href="https://wildalmonds.com/signup">Signup</a>
    <br />
    Once you have an account, the Create Tournament option is available from the Owner Page. Currently, the Create
    page allows you a free 4x4x4 Survey: 4 Almonds 4 Squares and 4 invites. We can easily create you a custom Survey
    outside the Demo restrictions.
    <h4>Invitation:</h4>
    Now that you have completed the Creation phase, you are ready to send your invitations to your participants.
    In the Owner Dashboard, you will see your Tournament board. Click or touch the Dashboard button.
    This displays your voting results as well as your invite cards. Invites are sent via
    Email from the wildalmonds@yahoo.com account. Please have your invitees search for a message from this sender.
    Fill that out for a new user and hit the <strong>Send It!</strong> button.
    <h4>Participation:</h4>
    Your participants receive within the email their own unique link to your  WildAlmonds Event. Clicking the link
    sends them to our site where they are greeted with your survey owner and  the description summary of what the
    survey is about. There, they choose the Accept button to link to the Event page. This page allows your participant
    to rank their choices via Almonds for your Squares. This is done via touchscreen or mouse by dragging the Almonds
    above the Square and releasing it. Once all picks are completed, the participant receives the Lock Picks button.
    More detail are available here at  <a href="https://wildalmonds.com/about/help">How to Play</a>
    <h4>Aggregation:</h4>
    Each Survey request sent appears in your Event report. We do not show which picks your users individually
    selected, we total those up. You will see when you sent the request, when the user last Accepted, and when the
    picks where Locked. For best results, please strongly encourage your participants to Lock their picks. As they
    change those picks, your results will change in your summarized totals.
    <h4>That is it!</h4>
    We have just walked through the solution end-to-end. It is simply a matter of inviting more
    participants to the Event via the Owner Panel. As results come in, you may see that you have a passionate base
    that supports a single option, but the Total for another is highest. This is your wisdom of the crowd
    selection and it deserves a consideration. The more invites you send, the better this reporting will be.
    <h4>Reminder</h4>
    We can easily customize the number of Invitations, Almonds and Squares for you. We need your help to grow the
    site. Please do give us your feedback, invite us to your Events, and let us earn your trust and partnership.
    Contact us at wildalmondz@gmail.com. We would love to hear from you. Or, setup a tournament with your own
    account and ask us through the application.
